# Ford 4.9L 300Ci inline 6  ## Important:  The Crankshaft bolts are Shorter on the Automatic Flexplate than Manual Flywheel! When you get a Transmission? Make SURE You take the Crankshaft Flywheel Bolts as well!!! Using the wrong bolts will not have enough Threads and can damage the flywheel under load.
